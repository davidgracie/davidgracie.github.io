Starting from 2nd October 2017, Amazon will be charging customers per second instead of per hour. This will be applied to a number of their services, including:

* EC2 instances
* EBS volumes
* EMR (Elastic MapReduce) big data processing
* AWS Batch
* Elastic GPUs
* Provisioned IOPS

This will be welcome news for many of Amazonâ€™s customers who have had to run complex management systems to get value for money on sub-hour workflows. A billing change like this ensures customers can be more flexible and save money when using EC2 instances for tasks not suited for AWS Lamba.

Have you been waiting for per-second billing? Have you switched back to using EC2 instances since this change?
