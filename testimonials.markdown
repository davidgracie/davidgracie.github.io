## Margaret Wills (Livingston Village Community Education Centre)

We recently took the decision to commission a website to promote our Community Centre and to provide the public with an automated booking process for room hire.

This was a complex mix of booking options involving pricing, date and time availability, together with meeting legal obligations for our charitable status, data protection legislation and ease of use for both the public using it and the team of volunteers to whom its’ running would eventually fall.

We cannot recommend highly enough the services of David Gracie Consulting Services in this undertaking, as this company, and David in particular, made the process very easy to work through.

No-one involved from the committee had any website or technical background, however, David was able to establish what was required and presented us with options to answer all of our needs. We are extremely pleased with the end result – it provides a professional and easy to navigate website for the general public, and, very importantly, also hugely reduces the workload for committee members to deal with in the future.

In summation, we have been provided with a superb product, in a professional manner, on time and on budget – a rarity indeed!

We cannot thank him enough for his hard work and dedication in providing a first class product for his customers.

## Stuart Reid (Clan Kilts Ltd)

Before David started working with us, we had a complicated IT setup that was difficult to manage day-to-day. We had different systems taking backups and storing them in different places which made disaster recovery slow. All our internal apps were running from different places so maintenance was challenging.

David quickly came up with a new architecture to make things a lot simpler and easier to manage. He then used his wealth of experience to make that architecture a reality. We now have several business apps running on the same platform, a successful e-commerce site and our backup and disaster recovery processes are much easier to follow.

We can’t thank him enough for all the hard work he’s put in over the years to make our business more efficient whilst increasing turnover and keeping costs affordable. He continues to provide us with much needed guidance on our IT infrastructure and would be, without hesitation, our first choice on future projects.

David helped me turn ideas into not just a functioning website but a professional destination which can attract me business and contacts. He continues to work with me on my internet strategy and design presentation.

## Jane McLeod (Gas Measurement Instruments Ltd)

I have had the pleasure of working alongside David for the last 4 years at GMI. He is an extremely talented and innovative Web Application Developer, always looking for new solutions and fresh ideas that can advance his knowledge to exceed his colleagues expectations and goals. David is passionate about web application development and always has a great awareness of new creative strategies and technology, which makes him a great asset to GMI. His attention to detail is impeccable. I would highly recommend David based on his web application experience, knowledge and personal skills.

## Fiona Brown (Scottish Cot Death Trust)

As a small charity, we wanted a new website which we could update ourselves, without incurring extra costs. We wanted a new website that was visually appealing, fresh and easy to navigate. David has given us everything we have asked for and we are delighted with our new site. David was a pleasure to work with, very professional and I would readily recommend him to anyone needing a new website.
